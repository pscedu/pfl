general
- watch out for sizeof(type var[0])
- constify RPC replies in clients and requests in servers
- check all bulkserver()'s for free_desc()
- sweep tree for \b0[0-9] and fix bad permissions (711 -> 700)
- tie PSCALLOC to pool reaping
- ctlapi GETTREE
- add psc_ prefix and psc_mt_ (multithread-safe) prefix to all pfl things
- type fixes:
	(o) s/U64CONST/UINT64_C/
	(o) inttypes.h PRI[dioux]64 in place of _P_U64 and LPX
	(o) s/u64/uint64_t/

slash
- piggyback small readdirs directly into READDIR replies

pfl
- no ifdefs
- disallow lock reinitialization (e.g. allow LOCK_INIT once)
- for psclog(), add extensibility mechanism for fmtstr,
  allowing app-specific callbacks (e.g. %r for zest clients)

lnet
- move iostats outside of socklnd

zest
- mount_zest test mode, how fast processes connect to fuse

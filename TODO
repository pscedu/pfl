make
- rename ROOTDIR -> PROJ_BASE
- introduce APP_BASE

general
- watch out for sizeof(type var[0])
- constify RPC replies in clients and requests in servers
- check all bulkserver()'s for free_desc()
- sweep tree for \b0[0-9] and fix bad permissions (711 -> 700)
- add cache pools, whose members are shared among list caches
- change _P_U64 to _P_64 since the conversion specifier decides unsigned or not

slash
- piggyback small readdirs directly into READDIR replies

pfl
- remove psclist_add
- no ifdefs
- disallow lock reinitialization (e.g. allow LOCK_INIT once)
- for psclog(), add extensibility mechanism for fmtstr,
  allowing app-specific callbacks (e.g. %r for zest clients)

lnet
- move iostats outside of socklnd
